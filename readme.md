##  Interactive Proof-of-Work Blockchain Network in Rust ðŸ¦€

An ongoing Rust-based project to build a decentralized Proof-of-Work blockchain network, with a command-line interface for interactions.

#### Running

Start multiple instances of the application on separate terminals to initialize new peers within the same peer-to-peer network.

```sh
cargo run
```
<!-- (RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin main) -->

#### Commands Overview
```sh
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€

  *Create new transaction*:
â””â”€â”€ Usage: `txn [data]`
â”Œâ”€â”€ Description:
â”‚     â€¢ Create a (random) transaction with the amount set to the given data, adding it to the pool, and broadcasting it to other peers.

  *Mine new block*:
â””â”€â”€ Usage: `mine ?[data]`
â”Œâ”€â”€ Description:
â”‚    â€¢ If no arguments are provided:
â”‚      -  mine a block containing the first transaction in the pool (if any), adding it to the chain, and broadcasting it to other peers.
â”‚     â€¢ If an argument is provided:
â”‚      -  mine a block containing the given data, adding it to the chain, and broadcasting it to other peers.

  *Request (and synchronise) chain from peers*:
â””â”€â”€ Usage: `req <"all" | [peer-id]>`
â”Œâ”€â”€ Options:
â”‚     â€¢ `"all"`      - Request chain from all peers, and synchronise to the most up-to-date chain
â”‚     â€¢ `[peer-id]`  - Request chain from a specific peer, and synchronise to the most up-to-date chain

  *Show peers/chain/transaction pool*:
â””â”€â”€ Usage: `show <"peers" | "chain" | "pool">`
â”Œâ”€â”€ Options:
â”‚     â€¢ `"peers"`   - Show list of discovered and connected peers
â”‚     â€¢ `"chain"`   - Show current chain
â”‚     â€¢ `"pool"`    - Show current transaction pool

  *Redial*:
â””â”€â”€ Usage: `redial`
â”Œâ”€â”€ Description:
â”‚     â€¢ Redial all discovered peers.

  *Command menu*:
â””â”€â”€ Usage: `help`
â”Œâ”€â”€ Description:
â”‚     â€¢ Prints this list of commands.
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€

### File Overview

#### `peer.rs`
Manages the core peer logic, providing the main application loop and interfaces for sending/receiving messages.
- Manages a Swarm object (for communicating with peers in the network).
- Manages std input events (for command-line interactions).
- Manages a local Chain object (which it both adds new mined blocks to and synchronises with other peers' chains).
- Manages a local Transaction pool (which it may mine new blocks for).

#### `swarm.rs`
Contains the network logic using GossipSub as the communication protocol and Mdns as the peer discovery protocol.
- Configures PeerId, Keypair, and Topic(s) for the network.
- Sets up NetworkBehaviour (that defines how peer discovery and message events are handled).
- Sets up Swarm (that executes the NetworkBehaviour).

#### `chain.rs`
Defines the blockchain and Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm.
- Chain internals, which manages a main chain and a hashmap of forks.
- Methods for accessing, mining, extending, and validating a chain's blocks with respect to other blocks, chains, or forks.

```sh
cargo test chain -- --no capture
```

#### `block.rs`
Provides the block and Proof-of-Work mining algorithm.
- Block internals.
- Methods for hashing, mining, and validating blocks.
- Result and error types from handling new blocks.

```sh
cargo test block -- --no capture
```

#### `transaction.rs`
Provides the transaction form.
- Transaction type.
- Methods for generating and validating transactions.

```sh
cargo test transaction -- --no capture
```

#### `message.rs`
Provides the message forms communicated between peers.
- Messages for requesting and responding with chains or new blocks.
- Messages for broadcasting new transactions.

#### `file.rs`
Provides auxiliary access to local storage.
- Functions for loading and saving the blockchain state (from `blocks.json`).

<!--
  Note:
  The Peer and NetworkBehaviour object never directly communicate. The Swarm is the intermediary that executes the one-way communication (the NetworkBehaviour sending messages to it the Peer via the local channel) describes in the code, when responding to events.
