# Layer 1 Network
A Layer 1 network is a network that acts as infrastructure for other applications, protocols, and networks to build on top of.

# Layer 1 Blockchain [https://metaschool.so/articles/layer-1-blockchain/]
A Layer 1 blockchain, therefore, is hence the foundation of a blockchain network. It is responsible for:
  - Blockchain itself and ledger
  The data structure of the ledger stored on the blockchain
  - Transaction processing
  L1 blockchains are responsible for all on-chain transactions, including executing and confirming them.
  - Consensus mechanisms
  - L1 blockchains use consensus models to process transactions, which vary by network and purpose.
  Infrastructure
  - L1 blockchains provide the infrastructure for smart contracts and decentralized applications.
  Native cryptocurrency
  - L1 blockchains use a native cryptocurrency to pay transaction fees and reward network security.

### Smart Contracts
A **smart contract** is a self-executing program that automates the actions required in a blockchain transaction.
It is represented by a program that contain agreements, or if-then conditions, that self-executing.
Since the process is entirely self-contained there does not need to be a 3rd party handling any
transactions between a buyer and seller, such as a lawyer.

# Web3?
**Web3** is a term for a decentralized internet that gives users more control over their data and online activity.

It *uses* blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof environment for data storage and transactions.
  - That is, Blockchain focuses on enables transparent recording transactions, while Web3 allows interactions between users and applications in a more decentralised and democratic way.

Web3 applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), allow for financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading without the need for traditional banks.

It aims to shift from the centralized Web2 model, dominated by large corporations, to a more open and trustless ecosystem.

## Web3: Evolution of the Internet

- **Web1**: Static content, read-only.
- **Web2**: Interactive platforms dominated by major companies.
- **Web3**: Decentralized applications (dApps) and user ownership.

## Components of Web3

1. **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**: Applications running on blockchain networks.
2. **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts automating agreements.
3. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Financial services without intermediaries.
4. **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: Community-governed entities.
5. **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**: Unique digital assets representing ownership.
6. **Cryptocurrencies**: Digital tokens for transactions and value storage.

## Use Cases

- **Decentralized Social Media**: User-controlled content and data.
- **DeFi**: Peer-to-peer financial services.
- **Marketplaces**: Direct commerce without intermediaries.
- **Digital Identity**: Self-sovereign identities for users.
- **Gaming**: Ownership of in-game assets.

# Decentralized Application: dApps

A **dApp** (decentralized application) is an application that runs on a decentralized network (like a blockchain). It typically consists of:
  - **Smart Contracts**: The backend logic of the application that runs on the blockchain.
  - **Frontend Interface**: A user interface that allows users to interact with the smart contracts (often a web or mobile app).
  - **Decentralization**: The application is designed to operate without a central authority, relying on the blockchain for data storage and execution.
