# Network Behaviours

In a P2P network, a network behavior defines how a peer interacts with the network, including how it sends and receives messages, handles connections, and manages protocols (like Pub/Sub, direct messaging, etc.).
In Rust's libp2p, a behavior is often implemented as a struct that encapsulates different protocols, events, and handlers.

### Different peers in the same peer-to-peer (P2P) network can indeed use different network behaviors.

For peers in a P2P network to coexist and communicate effectively, they need to have the following components in common:

 - Protocol compatibility (message formats and communication protocols). Like FloodSub
 - Peer discovery mechanism
 - Connection management strategies
 - Message handling and routing mechanisms
 - Security and authentication measures
 - Common event handling capabilities
